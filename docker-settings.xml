    Efficient usage of Maven is hard with Docker as the local repository does not provide the
    normal caching benefits.  Hence we need a local cache.  Sonatype has a nexus3 image that works
    right out of the box as a Maven Central cache.  Unfortunately this goes in ~/.m2/settings.xml
    that is outside the Docker context so we pass in this file instead.

    I have not found a good way to integrate this into a docker-compose environment, so it must be
    manually started with (strange formatting to avoid a double dash inside an XML comment)

docker run -p 8081:8081 -\
-name nexus sonatype/nexus3

    Cold start takes about a minute.

    Unfortunately we also have needed artifacts in our sbprojects nexus which again makes problems
    with the Nexus mirror proxy.  I found the following steps work with OSS 3.6.0-02:

    * Open http://localhost:8081
    * Sign into the nexus docker web interface as admin/admin123  (upper right corner)
    * Click on cog wheel in top bar (Server administration and configuration)
    * Select Repositories in left sidebar.
    * Click "Create Repository"
    * Choose "maven2 (proxy)" template.
    * Provide "sbforge" as the Name and "https://sbforge.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/" as the Remote storage location, and click "Create Repository".
    * Note: The repository list now lists "sbforge" too.
    * Click "Create repository".
    * Choose "maven2 (group)" template.
    * Use "sbforge_central" as the name, and add "maven-central" and "sbforge" to the Members pane, and click "Create Repository".
    * Note:  The repository list now lists "sbforge_central" too.

    Note that my external IP-number is currently hardcoded below.  Replace it with your own external IP-number.

    FIXME:  Automate all of the above.
