Developers Guide to DPA
===

This document contains information relevant to a developer who needs
to work on DPA.  

DPA requires a properly configured DOMS and Bitrepository.  The exact locations
are configured through properties provided to the main method.

DPA has been developed against a local installation
of DOMS+Bitrepository running in a VirtualBox image controlled by Vagrant. 
To get the full benefit a similar setup is recommended.  

Note:  You probably need at least 12 GB RAM to comfortably work with the Vagrant box
running.  


Java
--

Java 8 is required, as stream is used regularily.  Development has
been done primarily on OpenJDK 8/Oracle 8 JDK on Ubuntu 16.10.  It is
intended to be platform agnostic, and considered a bug if not.

Java 9 is *NOT* yet supported. 


Maven 
--

**Please notice that your local Maven settings must point to sbforge to
be able to resolve dependencies properly!**

DPA is a self-contained multi-module Maven project, which additionally
use a virtual machine with DOMS and a reference Bitrepository for
local development.  As of 2017-02-14 it is located under
"doms/doms-installer".  Please see the README.md there for further
information. 

This mean that all sources are available at once, and that all modules
have the same version.

Tomcat
---

As of 2017-04-06 it has been agreed that the configuration (which for
autonomous components is essentially loaded as a property file) is to
be provided as context parameters and avoid having a default value present
as Jens Henrik would like to be notified if a parameter is missing.  

TRA have done some initial work on getting IntelliJ to add this transparently
when deploying and not found an easy way, so for now use a "For DPA only" copy
of Tomcat when developing and add this snippet to 

    $CATALINA_BASE/conf/context.xml

just before the final `</Context>` line.  IntelliJ may require recreating the Run/Debug configuration
for Tomcat.

    <Parameter name="autonomous.sboi.url" value="http://localhost:58608/newspapr/sbsolr/"/>
    <Parameter name="doms.username" value="fedoraAdmin"/>
    <Parameter name="doms.password" value="fedoraAdminPass"/>
    <Parameter name="doms.pidgenerator.url" value="http://localhost:7880/pidgenerator-service"/>
    <Parameter name="doms.url" value="http://localhost:7880/fedora"/>
    <Parameter name="pageSize" value="10"/>
    <Parameter name="jvm.dumpheap" value="false"/>
    <Parameter name="bitrepository.ingester.baseurl" value="http://localhost:58709/"/>
    <Parameter name="autonomous.pastSuccessfulEvents" value="Data_Archived"/>
    <Parameter name="autonomous.oldEvents" value=""/>
    <Parameter name="autonomous.itemTypes" value="doms:ContentModel_DPARoundTrip"/>
    <Parameter name="autonomous.sboi.pageSize" value="100"/>
    <Parameter name="autonomous.futureEvents" value="XML_validated,Manually_stopped"/>
    <Parameter name="autonomous.thisEvent" value="XML_validated"/>
    <Parameter name="autonomous.component.fedoraRetries" value="10"/>
    <Parameter name="autonomous.component.fedoraDelayBetweenRetries" value="10"/>
    <Parameter name="doms.collection.pid" value="doms_sboi_dpaCollection"/>

The snippet is also present in dpa-dashboard/dashboard.xml which is packaged with the
war file in the deployment tarball.

(Note that the manual control web app written by MMJ has a embedded Jetty launcher running
as a normal Java application invoking `main(...)`).

Glassfish 4:
---

As of 2017-05-29 TRA found that for Glassfish 4 the simplest way to get the container configured, insert
the following in $GLASSFISH/domains/domain1/config/default-web.xml right after the `<web-app ...>` root tag.

IntelliJ
--

IntelliJ has been used as the primary IDE.  Use the usual File -> Open
on the root of the project to open it.   If some dependencies are
missing you most likely need to fix your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file.

See [tools/dpa-tools-ide-launchers](tools/dpa-tools-ide-launchers) 
project for launchers to be used inside IDE's to invoke the
autonomous components with the project resourcers (and the vagrant
image running).

The project should be IDE-agnostic and a pure Maven project.  If not, please fix as needed.  
Also do not put IDE specific files in the git repository.


Vagrant
---

TRA has worked with vagrant 1.8.6 downloaded directly from 
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html - the version coming with 
Ubuntu was too old when the project began.

See [vagrant/README.md](vagrant/README.md) for further information.



ABR
---

* Branch per issue
* First commit on branch is empty (`--allow-empty`) but with issue description as message
* Issues on <https://sbprojects.statsbiblioteket.dk/jira/projects/DPA/summary>
* Docs not on confluence, we use markdown files in this repo for docs
* Projektleder: Niels BÃ¸nding <nba@kb.dk>

* vagrant is used for doms/bitrepo
* docker for doms is still under development

* release is not based on mvn release plugin
* Instead, branch name and git commit is used in tarball name
* This tarball `tools/dpa-tools-deployment/target/dpa_master_20af068.tar.gz` is 
copied to `dpaviser@achernar`
This is the only thing that is shipped to Drift. If anything needs to be changed, it
should be changed in the orig. files.


Maven versions are "master-SNAPSHOT" for everything here.  

Make _branch_ from master named from milestone/release. 

Note, git commit id is not only in tarball name. It is also shown in log messages, 
so a logfile automatically identifies the the version of code it is from.

This is done via. tools/dpa-tools-deployment/pom.xml, which uses appassembler to make
the java wrappers, with the git info, which maven gets from the `git-commit-id-plugin`


Milestones
1. ?
2. ?
3. ?
4. Verapdf

```
. Master
|
*
|
*------>* release4
|       |
|       * hotfix 
*<-----/    Merge fix back if relevant
|
*
```

Do NOT merge master (or even other branches ) to released branch. If change is minor, 
do hotfix, otherwise work on master (actually issue branch from master) and make
new release branch afterwards.
  

#### Autonomous Components. 

 \* is already done
 
 \+ is in the current release and being worked on

 \! Next priority for TRA
 
 \% Last priority for TRA

1. \* Create delivery/ initiator osv component
2. \* Doms Ingester + bit repo component: one component ingests in both. Waits for bitrepo to finish. Can do 10 deliveries per day. 

3. \+ Checksum regenerator: Iterates doms and bitrepo for the ingested files (xml and data) and recalcs checksum.

    Checksum regen to ensure ingest is correct. Ensures more than checksums. Ensures that the doms tree structure and 
    bitrepo links encompass the whole delivery. 
4. \+ Validate checksum/file list from checksum regenerator

Now use three components concurrently

1. \! Mark as deleted on disk (jhlj)
2. \% xml validator
3. \% PDF:
    1. PDF renderer: Render the pdf to thumbnail to "ensure" that the pdf is valid
    2. VeraPDF metadata: Extract pdf-a condition violations
    3. VeraPDF reporter: Check pdf-a condition violations against rules from KFC. 

If anything fails, a MANUAL_CONTROL event is set on the delivery and further processing (of this) is stopped.  


#### Webinterfaces

Vaadin interface for quality control, MMJ

##### TRA: Dashboard.

Still needs work: Java EE 7 app due to needing Glassfish (module 'dpa-dashboard-javaee7')

Mostly done: Wrapping/deployment to allow running in Tomcat 8 (module 'dpa-dashboard')
