<p>Provides interfaces for getting objectmodel of deliveries and writing to disk or fedora</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>


<p>This package contains two keyclasses DeliveryFedoraCommunication and DeliveryFilesystemReadWrite.</p>

<p>DeliveryFedoraCommunication is used to read or write information to fedora.
    The system initially reads the filestructure from Fedora, when writing from the application information is written to both Fedora and the filesystem.
    Since some lookup in Fedora is very slow some lookups is only performed in the filesystem, and cashed from fedora, if the files is missing.
