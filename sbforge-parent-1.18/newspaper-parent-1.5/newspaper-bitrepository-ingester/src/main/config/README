The component will need a set of configuration files that are not included here. 
The files are:
- RepositorySettings.xml - The file defining the concrete bitrepository system
- ReferenceSettings.xml  - The configuration file needed by bitrepository.org reference client
- client-cert.pem        - The certificate file that is constitutes the access credentials for the concrete bitrepository system. 
                           The certificates needs to be of the PEM format with at least the "PRIVATEKEY" and "CERTIFICATE" sections
